# ECG_Compression

This prototype demonstrated the linear predictive coding and compression algorithms applied for ECG transmission using MATLAB.

The code will later implemented to ECG firmware as well as Android App.

#03 Oct 2016
The linear predictive coding has been implemented on both testing data 1441601992540_1 and MIT-BIH ECG Compression DB. The result shows the algorithm performs well except QES area, which is logical and expected.
